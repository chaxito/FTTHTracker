<!--Project Description  -->

## Project Description

Currently Fibre to the Home (FTTH) customers do not have a direct way of tracking the record of events in the scenario where a ticket has been raised to curb their issues, e.g installation of fibre at home, LOS issue to be sorted by technician, etc

Therefore;

This project is meant to create a web application that enables the end users (Fibre to the Home internet customers) to track the record of events in the occurrence a ticket is raised.


## Setup Instruction

There is no any script required to run the application, all you need to do is to visit the <strong>project URL link</strong> [here](link url)


## Technologies Used

The program will basically use JavaScript as the programming language and bootstrap as the style language.
